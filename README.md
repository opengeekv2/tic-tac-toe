# Rules

* X always goes first
* Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on the board
* Players cannot play on a played position
* A player with 3 X’s or 3 O’s in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally) wins the game.
* If all 9 squares are filled and neither player achieves 3 in a row, the game is a draw.
